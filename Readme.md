# CSS Guide

This a repo to keep the knowledge from the udemy tutorial [CSS - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/css-the-complete-guide-incl-flexbox-grid-sass/) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller and Manuel Lorenz

Will be divide in modules to move the basics topics to advance ones.

Only need to have basic knowledge about HTML and CSS3 to follow this.

# Reminders IMPORTANT

## Outline
We use **outline** to avoid the blue border the web browser has for default. Use it on pseudo class **focus** and to avoid the blue border put **none**.

## Float
We use **clear** to affect **float**, this will correct the way how will behaviour (Will move the direction as we want without affecting others).

## Position
- Every element has **position:static** as default.
- Adding **position:relative** to the element *father* and adding **position:absolute** to the element child. The element child position will take the element father as guide for the position that we want put the child element
- If the element has **position:relative** (without child element). Will take the initial position where it is. And the movement of the element will take from the initial position.

## Overflow
- Adding **overflow:hidden** to a element, will affect the child element
